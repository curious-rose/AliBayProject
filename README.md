 This is the front and back end of AliBay, a mid-term project by a team of 3 students in the DecodeMTL Web Developer Bootcamp.

The front-end is done in React, and the "back-end" is in fact all run client-side, with authentication for client-side data requests being
taken care of by Google Firebase Authentication.

Modules used in the front-end include React Router DOM and Firebase.
